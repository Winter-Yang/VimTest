As we mentioned in our Week One post, the Engineering team here at Elastic wanted to celebrate the end of the 2017 Calendar via our own tech-advent series. We took a lot of inspiration from both the Elastic Stack calendar Qiita (fully in Japanese) and SysAdvent (in English) and weâ€™d like to thank them for providing the awesome quality we have aspired to maintain.

We have summarised weeks one, two and three in previous blog posts, and this post covers the last and final (all be it short) week and also provides a summary of all the topics that were posted in the series.
